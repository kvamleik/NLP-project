Extract from master thesis project. 

For text classification, we used Python to train and test our models as well as to predict the
final label for each of the documents. Word embeddings was done by using the terminal to
clone the repository from Github, changing the necessary code and then transforming the data
in Python. For topic modelling, we used Python to categorize and visualize the different topics.
Finally, for the visualization of our text classification, we used Tableau.

The different models applied were multinomial naïve bayes (MNB), linear suport vector machines (SVM), random forest and logistic regression.

**Abstract**

A strong brand is more important than ever with today’s highly complex multi-stakeholder
relationships where consumers are also becoming brand co-creators. Further, companies today
are increasingly exposed to corporate crises as news travel faster and the number of salient
stakeholders is exploding.

This thesis combines brand management and crisis management with a methodological
approach that allows for a large quantification of relevant topics and sentiments on social media
and in newspapers during a crisis. It leverages text classification, word embeddings and topic
modelling to better describe how people react, and how companies should respond during a
corporate crisis. The collected data in this quantitative study are based on millions of tweets
and almost 100 news articles. It focuses on five international brands, namely EasyJet, Boeing,
Tesla, Nike and Gillette, all of which have been processed and analyzed using Python. Based
on a brand model framework, the data is labelled and analyzed in four different categories
which then help to apply a crisis-identification-to-response model.

Results show that crises revolving around non-product-related attributes and symbolic
benefits tend to be more complex and case dependent compared to product-related and
functional crises. It also shows that brand personality has a key influence on which response
strategy should be chosen. Further, it is found that the type of media used to respond to a crisis
does not have an influence in isolation but must be evaluated together with other parameters
such as the response strategy. Finally, it is shown that for some companies, the alignment
between brand personality, a clear response strategy and the choice of media can, in fact, turn
a crisis into an opportunity.

We discuss the results and propose a framework, MI-MARE, based on the existing
literature combined with our own findings, which can help brand and communication managers
to navigate companies through corporate crises. The framework suggests that managers in the
future should first focus on ongoing monitoring and identification of a crisis. Second, they
should focus on mapping the relevant brand associations, understanding their stakeholders’
attribution of a cause, respond in alignment with their brand’s perceived brand personality, and
finally, they should evaluate how stakeholders react to the response. Third, and last, we suggest
that managers collect and use all the relevant data, as done in this thesis, and learn from the
crisis to become better prepared in the future.

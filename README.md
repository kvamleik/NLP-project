Extract from master thesis project. 

For text classification, we used Python to train and test our models as well as to predict the
final label for each of the documents. Word embeddings was done by using the terminal to
clone the repository from Github, changing the necessary code and then transforming the data
in Python. For topic modelling, we used Python to categorize and visualize the different topics.
Finally, for the visualization of our text classification, we used Tableau.

The different models applied were multinomial na√Øve bayes (MNB), linear suport vector machines (SVM), random forest and logistic regression.
